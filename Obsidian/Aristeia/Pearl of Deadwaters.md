A prison named The Pearl of Deadwaters.

The prison imprisoned: The Darkness(escaped the plane), Imedraz the clockwork angel (killled), Kyu'uchizan and the other archdevils (escaped, probably escaped the plane or died died), Lunghos (left in prison), a shapechanger (left in prison).

The Darkness, imprisoned God. Caused the eternal dark. Was teleported out of the plane by the scavengers.

Imedraz the clockwork angel, a plane traveler from Mechanus, may hold the secret to finding a reliable way of travelling the planes.

Archdevil summoner and Madoka's Patron. Uses borrowed power. Escaped the Pearl of Deadwaters after being trapped there since at least Year 0. Probably wants the Scale of Tiamat to overthrown whoever they're borrowing power from.
