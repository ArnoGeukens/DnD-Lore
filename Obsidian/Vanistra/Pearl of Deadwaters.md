Under Ellyon is a prison named The Pearl of Deadwaters that holds a primeval god of darkness. In this same prison it also holds a handful of other dangerous creatures who have been sealed there by a servant of the old world.

Sinvar is tasked to protect it.

The Pearl is hidden in the underdark near the crystal sword deep within the abyss. Only those with true vision can see the entrance of the sphere. The prison is surrounded by water and Dead Magic. An immortal guardian protects the entrance (Koi Carp). It may seem impossible to reach but given the right timing and the proper tools it could be done.

Inside is an ancient divine construct, created as a champion of the gods to protect the prison of The Darkness.

Still imprisons Imedraz the clockwork angel, Lunghos and a shapechanger.
Imedraz the clockwork angel, a plane traveler from Mechanus, may hold the secret to finding a reliable way of travelling the planes.

Kyu'uchizan and the other archdevils have escaped.
