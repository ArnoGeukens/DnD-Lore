"_The book is a biography of Aya Sativatus a legendary weaponsmith who died in the year 231 written by Ojin Luxen in the year 439._

_The book mentions that Aya lived her entire life in Mayheath. Since Mayheath is a very isolated society there is very little information on her life. The book focuses mostly on the weapons she made. Also some notes were added by Aujusck Sapphire on top of the book mostly detailing estimated value of the weapons.)_

  

There's a dozen pages detailing some earlier project most of which seems uninteresting from a glance.

  

**Tensin Blade collection**

A unique collection made by Aya Sativatus in the year 225 Sun Tensin and his group of swordsman were travelling the world testing their skills and searching for good bladesmith. they asked Aya to make a blade for each of them. Out of all the blades they received this collection was by far the best. Sun Tensin then went on becoming the world's greatest swordsman duelist and he made it known to the world that Aya was the greatest bladesmith in the world. She then received insane request from all around the world.
