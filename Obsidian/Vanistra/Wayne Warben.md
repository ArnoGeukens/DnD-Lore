Owner of Wayne Warben Wondrous Wares. Gave you a seashell. Turns out he's the real deal but his whole place was ripped to pieces by the greater being known as The Reaper. he is now currently working on making automaton to fight against The Reaper and claim back the missing part of his shop all the while being annoyed by a new apprentice.Â He was presumably killed by Touxankes.

Was supposed to be a guardian like Sinvar but was lazy and became a merchant instead. His shop was located near the realm of death.
