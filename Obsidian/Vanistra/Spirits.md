Led by Manitou, the God Best Left Forgotten, and Gitche, follower of the Darkness God.

Notable is Nemesis, who has lived hundreds of years and has a legendary mask from Solimbus.

Wants to use the scale of Tiamat for Manitou to become a demigod and remove magic from Venistra.
But actually: probably wants to consume the scale as well as the Greater Beings to get his power as a God back, then release the Darkness God as well, leading to the destruction of the plane.
