Destruction of the Weave.

Happened in Biham by Kaireganes Opal.

Caused by an experiment using the Scale of Tiamat + alien technology. The Scale was hooked up as a power source to the alien technology, and aimed at by it. When receiving magic damage the scale absorbs it as well as siphons power from the weave. The loop went out of control, sapped magic from the weave (~1/4th of our continent's?).

Will lead to the end of the world (dissipation of the weave) ~March 20th, and devastating effects are likely much sooner.
