Energy can come from many different sources and can be divided in a nearly infinite amount of sub-categories with small variations. This list has the major categories and some unique outliers.

Magic:  Controlled and restrictive. There exist many different variants created by different beings in different planes but the template of The Weave is the most common to the fabric of planes.

Psionic / Soul: A subdivision of all created non-divine beings. A source of energy that has the ability to slowly grow and evolve. Tends to afflict cognitive conditions to items making them significantly more annoying to use.

Anti-Energy / Erasure: The normal state of any known atmosphere is to have energy or to not have any energy. Erasure represents negative energy, anything near an unleashed source of Anti-Energy will be absorbed until the atmosphere goes back to its normal state. The same quantity of Anti-Energy used in a low energy area will annihilate a much larger area than if it was used in a very high energy area.

Null: More common in certain planes, null is a much less deadly variant of Anti-Energy. It is not energy, but it interacts with it. When larger sources of energy enter contact with Null it dissolves energy until there is very little left usually draining creatures and breaking items. Materials can be infused with Null but no complex items can be made from it.

Divine: one of the first energy source of the universe*. The undiluted energy from divine beings. Related to Creation and Erasure. Energy type is mainly tied to the divine creating the item, if the divine dies the items weakens.


Notable Magic Variants :

Cosmic: Cosmic energy is an unstable, chaotic mash of potentially any other energy types. The Cosmic Slug** is a major divine force that moves through the astral sea consuming smaller planes on it's way. The strange trail of energy left behind is what is the most common form of Cosmic Energy. Many Magical Anomalies*** across the multiverse can end up becoming Cosmic energy. It is unreliable and sometimes very dangerous to use.

Twisted Anomaly: From the plane of Limbo which is Related to the Elemental Chaos* There are many different chaotic powers converging within Limbo but there is one particular source known as the Twisted Anomaly. Ever since it was discovered Syrrin**** has been fiercely guarding it. The Twisted Anomaly emanates a great aura of power and two different traces of energy have been found on hundreds of different planes both linking to the Twisted Anomaly.

Medeskar: Massive quantities of pure energy. An interesting plane but too dangerous to explore properly. Power can be pulled from the plane using physical marks combining body, soul and the energy of the plane in one outlet. The process is permanent and has high risks of self-destruction.


Notable Divine Variants :

Dawn: Ancient energy from Primordials*. It works similarly to Divine energy but will react aggressively against it.

Kru'aezor: Ancient creatures that inherently have energy similar yet distinctive to both Divine and Dawn energy.

Sands of Time: Mainly caused by Kronos a major divine force. The sands of time are related to time, fairly easy to collect but very complicated to use. Some vortex technology pairs well with this energy. *****


Vortex:
Vortex is the one true source of energy. First discovered millennia ago by the First Crew it revolutionized the multiverse. Nowadays over 95% of items used in our day to day life is Vortex. All details pertaining to the creation of Vortex items can be found in Vortex and Chemical Encyclopedia - Alpha restricted.
To put it simply, Vortex energy is a type of technological enhancement that can absorb any other energy within a certain range and convert it into an efficient, resilient and reliable source of energy. Regardless of the situation Vortex items will function as intended for up to 1000 years. The only negative aspect is that Vortex has a very slow energy output. To counterbalance this negative aspect, Vortex Energy Cores or VEC were invented by the First Crew.
VEC are designed to contain specific energy types and can come in a variety of size. The second most powerful VEC, Epsilon restricted, is the Matter Core which contains a very specific mix of most energy types. (See Vortex and Chemical Encyclopedia) The Matter Core is less energy efficient than any other VEC but has the flexibility of being able to use nearly all types and some radically more effective variants and combinations. The only VEC more powerful is the Myriad Core, Alpha restricted.
