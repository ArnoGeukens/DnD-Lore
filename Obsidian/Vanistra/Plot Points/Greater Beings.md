The 7 greater beings are a part of the weave that was torn (which made a null magic zone). They were born long ago when Vanistra was just a playground of magic and chaos. They are usually calm. If you anger one of them they will destroy everything and often cause permanent change to the landscape. They all represent different part of the elemental weave and they all have some form of immortality. Usually when they die they calm down on their next life. They are more akin to natural disaster then creatures.

They were created from The God Best Left Forgotten's power.
