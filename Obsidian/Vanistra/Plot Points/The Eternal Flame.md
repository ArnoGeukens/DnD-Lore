"The island, it attracts people, it distorts their perception of time, made them complacent, the barrier is a one way entrance that doesn't allow people to leave. This is not an island this is a prison...

The eternal flame is not exactly what it seems either. From what I heard it could be a greater being... the 7th greater being to be exact and it serves as the source of energy that powers the barrier surrounding the island."
Probably The Golem is the 7th Greater Being, not the Flame.

There can only ever be seven Immortals of the Eternal Flame using stone hearts. Immortals from this method are Stoneskin.

"The golem and the heart of the phenix grants you eternal life. You are the xth Stoneskin."

Lydia Lapis is the 1st Stoneskin.
Deron Argenus is the 2nd Stoneskin.
Anima is the 3rd Stoneskin.
Chimerran is the 4th Stoneskin.
Umbra The Living is the 5th Stoneskin.
Tarvak Bevanyr is the 6th Stoneskin.
ʻAlalā is the 7th Stoneskin.
