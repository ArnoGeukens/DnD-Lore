God Best Left Forgotten.

Only a few years after ascending to Divinity he tore Vanistra's weave. After he tore the Weave (which made the null magic zone), his power was used to create the Greater Beings and repair some of the weave and his body was locked up in stone on Solimbus to be forgotten.

The being called Great Spirit's Hatred also stems from The Great Spirit. Its nature is unusual it is part fey and part many things.

His guardian was killed by Gitche, who released Manitou to help free the Darkness god.

Regained some power from a pool of primordial energy under Ellyon.

Manitou, a dangerous creature his origin are unknown but he is a puppeteer who loves power. He may be able to manipulate dreams. Staying anywhere close to him is not recommended. For some reason Manitou never seem to leave Ellyon.Â 
Mysteriously appeared in Ellyon a few hundred years ago. Has always been very friendly the criminals and slowly developped his own group named Spirits. He has power of necromancy, Mass teleportation and some weird voodoo abilities.

Seems to hate the Weave.

"You should not learn of me. Soulless monstrosities should know their place within this world."

"The Creator of all things and the Giver of life. The Great Mystery. Forgotten..."

If Manitou can kill and absorb the Greater Beings he can become Divine again.
