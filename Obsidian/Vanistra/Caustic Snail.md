(Acid / Poison) When the Snail dies it is reborn from its egg it laid during its life. The egg is incredibly hard to destroy and the snail will always try to protect it. It moves quite slowly but it leaves deadly toxin behind. It created the poison marshland and the pit of despair in the underdark.

Caustic Snail blessed are called Plague Bringers.
Sadie is a Plague Bringer.
Ruo Ruo is a Plague Bringer.

The caustic snail is currently likely in a hole near Keurichom.
