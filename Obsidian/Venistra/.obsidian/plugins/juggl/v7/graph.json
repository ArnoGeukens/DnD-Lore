He was named Ryūjin. he would always help everyone he could. He took a particular liking to an underwater merfolk city named Davarak in which he decided to build his home. The palace was named Ryūgū-jō. \n\nRyūjin spent many peaceful years teaching the people of Davarak. He would create magical items to help them in their day to day lives. \n\nBut one day, Tiamat created an ultimate champion of destruction to prove her superiority to Bahamut. The demi-god Master of the sky. The evil and powerful Azharul. His goal was the destruction of Davarak and Ryūjin and he would eradicate anything in its path. \n\nAzharul was powerful, he was truly the most perfect creation of Tiamat. His scales were protected from magic and were more resistant then adamantine making it impossible for anything to pierce through them. Its breath was so powerful it could be compared to the Silver Fire itself. In a single breath it could erase hundreds of lives from existence and use their souls as energy. \n\nBut Bahamut believed that Ryūjin alongside the people of Davarak could triumph and warned him to prepare for the arrival of Azharul. \n\nRyūjin created 3 legendary items for the strongest warriors of Davarak to use in the battle against Azharul. Skypiercer a lance of lightning that could fight by itself. The Abyssal Chains that could not be broken even by a demi-god and finally Ryūjin's Tear an azure stone empowered by his own power that could control the weather.\n\nThe battle was grand and epic and in the end Ryūjin and the citizen of Davarak triumphed over Azharul and the evil dragon fell from the Sky and was binded by the Abyssal Chains to be an eternal prisoner of Ryūgū-jō. \n\nHowever, Tiamat accused Bahamut of interfering with the battle and changing the outcome and in a fit of rage she destroyed Davarak and killed Ryūjin herself.
