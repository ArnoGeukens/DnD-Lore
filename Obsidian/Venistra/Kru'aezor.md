An original being, doesn't seem connected to the weave, to psionic, to divine and isn't exactly Null either, it doesn't eradicate magic it simply is neutral to it. It may be a being born from something completely different... Something to do with souls.

Connected to green starmetal, harder than even adamantine and pretty good for enchanting.
