Manitou, a dangerous creature his origin are unknown but he is a puppeteer who loves power. He may be able to manipulate dreams. Staying anywhere close to him is not recommended. For some reason Manitou never seem to leave Ellyon.Â 
Mysteriously appeared in Ellyon a few hundred years ago. Has always been very friendly the criminals and slowly developped his own group named Spirits. He has power of necromancy, Mass teleportation and some weird voodoo abilities.

Seems to hate the Weave.

After he tore the Weave (which made the null magic zone), his power was used to create the Greater Beings and his body was locked up on Solimbus.

His guardian was killed by Gitche, who released Manitou to help free the Darkness god.
