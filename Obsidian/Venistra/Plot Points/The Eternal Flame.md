"The island, it attracts people, it distorts their perception of time, made them complacent, the barrier is a one way entrance that doesn't allow people to leave. This is not an island this is a prison...

The eternal flame is not exactly what it seems either. From what I heard it could be a greater being... the 7th greater being to be exact and it serves as the source of energy that powers the barrier surrounding the island."

There can only ever be seven Immortals of the Eternal Flame. Eternal Flame immortals are Stoneskin.

"The golem and the heart of the phenix grants you eternal life. You are the xth Stoneskin.""

Maybe "The golem" is the 7th greater being, not the flame?
